        <h1>TESS India OER Apps installation</h1>
        <p>First you will need to download the following APKs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/static/apps/kiwix-1.93.apk">Kiwix</a></li>
            <li><a href="/static/apps/ODK Collect v1.4.5 rev 1048.apk">ODK collect</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Open the list of apps on your phone. This may be done through 
            something like a four by four grid of rectangles in the 
            right hand corner, or a circle with two rows of three dots in it.
            Then find the 'Settings' app and open it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have done that, scroll down until you see 'Security'. Go 
            into the security settings and check a box called 'Unknown sources'.
            Read the warning message and select 'OK'. If decide that you're 
            unwilling to do that, you won't be able to follow the rest of the 
            instructions on this guide.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After downloading, open My Files (or another android file browser)  
            and open the "Download" folder on the device. The APKs you 
            downloaded should be inside. Depending on which application you 
            used to download the apps, they may be in a different folder. 
            If MyFiles isn't installed, use a web browser like Chrome and go to
            'file:///sdcard/Download'. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Run each APK select "Install" or possibly "Next" and then "Install". 
            Once it has installed, select 'Done'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Put your SD card into the server and click the following link to 
            copy the TESS India catalogue on to it.
            <a href="copy_tess_india.html">Copy TESS India archive to SD card</a>
        </p>
        <p>Now transfer the SD card from the server to your phone and use Kiwix to open the archive.</p>

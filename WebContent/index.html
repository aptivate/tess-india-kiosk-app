        <h1>TESS India OER Apps installation</h1>
        <p>First you will need to download the following APKs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/static/apps/kiwix-1.93.apk">Kiwix</a></li>
            <li><a href="/static/apps/ODK Collect v1.4.5 rev 1048.apk">ODK collect</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            After downloading, open My Files (or another android file browser)  
            and open the "Download" folder on the device. The APKs you 
            downloaded should be inside. Depending on which application you 
            used to download the apps, they may be in a different folder. 
            If MyFiles isn't installed, use a web browser like Chrome and go to
            'file:///sdcard/Download'. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Run each APK and select "Install".
        </p>
